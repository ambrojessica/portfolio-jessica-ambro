      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <h5>I'm a Front End Web Developer based in Salt Lake City, Utah.</h5>
      <p>I'm 22 years old, originally from Chicago, Illinois. I started my coding journey at the beginning of 2020 with FreeCodeCamp. I was super interested in HTML and CSS however not so keen to learn about Javascript. I applied to BloomTech (FKA Lambda School) and I was accepted in! Typically the Full-Stack Web Development course takes 6 months however, I took my sweet time to fully indulge in the knowledge. I am now a graduate of BloomTech which is a coding bootcamp and I am ready to start my tech career.</p>
